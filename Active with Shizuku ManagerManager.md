# Active Ice Box using Shizuku App

Shizuku App can help you to activate Ice Box with the "Wireless Debugging" feature without rooting or a computer:

1. Wireless debugging requires Android 11 or higher.
2. You will need to reactive it every time after restarting the phone. Otherwise Ice Box will not be able to freeze and unfreeze apps.

The activation steps are as follows:

1. Install [Shizuku Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api).
2. Activate it using the "Wireless Debugging" feature according to [the official Shizuku Guide](https://shizuku.rikka.app/guide/setup/#start-via-wireless-debugging).

Then open Ice Box and select Shizuku mode. You will need to reactivate Shizuku every time after rebooting.
